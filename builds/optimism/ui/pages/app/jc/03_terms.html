                    <p>
                    If you requested the performance of services begin during the cancellation period, you are required to pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been performed until you have communicated to us your decision to cancel this contract. We will reimburse to you any amount you have paid above this proportionate payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If you provide express consent to the supply of digital content during the cancellation period and acknowledge that your right to cancel the contract is lost by the supply of digital content during the cancellation period, you will no longer have a right to cancel the contract.
                    We will make the reimbursement using the same form of payment as you used for the initial purchase unless you have expressly agreed otherwise. You will not incur any fees because of the reimbursement.
                    This right to cancel and to reimbursement is not affected by any return or refund policy we may have.
                    </p>
